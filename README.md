###  Project Overview

This application moves beyond simple spreadsheets to provide a **Financial Governance Engine** for niche assets. Key features include:

* **Risk Engine:** Automated multi-factor risk scoring based on asset class, valuation staleness, and liquidity.
* **Audit Trail:** Immutable logging of all valuation changes and "soft delete" archiving to ensure data integrity.
* **Analytics:** Real-time visualization of portfolio allocation.
* **Security:** Secure session management and multi-tenant data isolation.

###  Local Installation & Setup

If you wish to run the code locally instead of using the live demo:

1. **Unzip the project** and navigate to the folder.

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
